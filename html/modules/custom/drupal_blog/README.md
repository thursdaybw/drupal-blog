## INTRODUCTION

The Drupal Blog module is a just a blog for me, Bevan

The primary use case for this module is to provide a place for me to
require the default_content module and some basic content.

## REQUIREMENTS

Depends on the default_content module so can provide some default nodes.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.
