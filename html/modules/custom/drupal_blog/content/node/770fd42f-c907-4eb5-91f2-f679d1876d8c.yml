    value: "## Introduction\n\nGreetings, fellow PHP developers! I'm John, and I've\
      \ embarked on a journey to integrate the Basiq API into a straightforward web\
      \ application. The objective? To fetch account balance details for a specific\
      \ savings account from a specific bank. I'm operating on a Manjaro Linux system\
      \ and have chosen Docker and Lando as my development environment. This blog\
      \ post is a thorough guide that will walk you through my journey, including\
      \ the commands I executed, the critical information snippets from their output,\
      \ and the decisions they led to.\n\n## Setting up the Local Development Enviorment\
      \ - Overview\n\nWith a good understanding of the Basiq API, I moved on to setting\
      \ up the local development environment. This involved installing Docker and\
      \ Lando on my Manjaro Linux system. Docker is a platform that allows you to\
      \ automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications, while Lando\
      \ is a free, open-source, and cross-platform local development environment.\n\
      \n### Overcoming Challenges\n\nSetting up the local development environment\
      \ was not without its challenges. I encountered an issue with a missing libcrypt\
      \ library when starting Lando. This issue prevented me from starting my local\
      \ development environment. However, with some assistance, I was able to resolve\
      \ this issue by installing the missing library.\n\n### The Unexpected Tangents\n\
      \nDuring the process of setting up the local development environment, I encountered\
      \ a warning about the Docker version being incompatible with Lando. The Docker\
      \ version installed was 24.0.2, while Lando supports Docker versions in the\
      \ range of 18.09.3 - 20.10.99. This led me down an unexpected path of attempting\
      \ to downgrade Docker to a version compatible with Lando.\n\n### Attempting\
      \ to Downgrade Docker\n\nDowngrading Docker proved to be a challenge. The package\
      \ manager in Manjaro does not support installing specific versions of a package.\
      \ I tried using the downgrade utility, setting environment variables, and even\
      \ considering manually installing Docker. However, none of these attempts were\
      \ successful.\n\n### Backtracking and Looking Ahead\n\nAfter several attempts\
      \ to downgrade Docker, I decided to put this issue aside for the time being.\
      \ I backtracked and tested if Lando would work with the newer Docker version,\
      \ despite the compatibility warning. If Lando works as expected, I can continue\
      \ using the current setup. If not, I will need to find another solution for\
      \ the Docker version compatibility issue.\n\nThe journey so far has been a mix\
      \ of learning, overcoming challenges, and dealing with unexpected turns. However,\
      \ each step, each challenge, and each tangent has been a stepping stone towards\
      \ my goal. As I look ahead, I am excited to continue this journey, to implement\
      \ the Basiq API into my web application, and to share my experiences along the\
      \ way. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to navigate this journey.\n\
      \n## Setting Up a Local Development Environment - Detail\n\nThis record is all\
      \ about setting up a local development environment using Docker and Lando. This\
      \ included setting up a local web server, implementing user authentication,\
      \ retrieving account balance information, displaying account balance information,\
      \ and error handling and testing. I started by updating my system's package\
      \ list and installing Docker on my Manjaro Linux system for compatibility with\
      \ Lando. Here are the commands I used:\n\nUpdate Package List\n\nThis command\
      \ updates the package list and upgrades all the system software to the latest\
      \ version. pacman is the package manager that comes with Manjaro, and it's the\
      \ most appropriate tool for this task.\n\n```\nsudo pacman -Syu\n```\n\nInstll\
      \ Docker\n\n```\nsudo pacman -S docker\n```\n\nThe output was quite lengthy,\
      \ but here's a snippet:\n\n```\n:: Synchronizing package databases...\n core\
      \ is up to date\n extra is up to date\n community is up to date\n:: Starting\
      \ full system upgrade...\nresolving dependencies...\nlooking for conflicting\
      \ packages...\nPackages (2) containerd-1.4.3-1  docker-1:20.10.2-1\nTotal Download\
      \ Size:   90.74 MiB\nTotal Installed Size:  383.56 MiB\n\n:: Proceed with installation?\
      \ [Y/n] Y\n:: Retrieving packages...\n containerd-1.4.3-1-x86_64 downloading...\n\
      \ docker-1:20.10.2-1-x86_64 downloading...\n:: Running post-transaction hooks...\n\
      (1/1) Arming ConditionNeedsUpdate...\n```\nStart the docker service\n\nI then\
      \ started the Docker service. This command starts the Docker service. systemctl\
      \ is a system management command from systemd, which is the init system used\
      \ in Manjaro. Starting the Docker service is necessary for using Docker to run\
      \ containers.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl start docker\n```\n\nEnable Docker service\
      \ to start on boot\n\nThis command sets the Docker service to start automatically\
      \ at boot. This is important to ensure that Docker is always available when\
      \ the system starts, even after a reboot.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl enable docker\n\
      ```\n\nVerify Docker installation\n\nThis command checks the installed version\
      \ of Docker. Verifying the Docker version is a good practice to ensure that\
      \ the installation was successful and that the correct version of Docker is\
      \ installed.\n\n```\ndocker --version\n```\n\nHello world\n\nThis command runs\
      \ a simple Docker image called hello-world. This is a common way to test a Docker\
      \ installation. The hello-world image is designed to output a message confirming\
      \ that Docker is working correctly.\n\n```\ndocker run hello-world\n```\n\n\
      However, I encountered a permission denied error, indicating that my current\
      \ user didn't have the necessary permissions to communicate with the Docker\
      \ daemon. I then added my user to the Docker group:\n\nError:\n\n```\nGot permission\
      \ denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock:\
      \ Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/create: dial unix\
      \ /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied\n```\n\nThis error message\
      \ indicates that my current user doesn't have the necessary permissions to communicate\
      \ with the Docker daemon. The Docker daemon runs with root privileges, and by\
      \ default, only the root user and users in the docker group have the permissions\
      \ to interact with it.\n\nI then proceeded to add my user to the docker group.\n\
      \nThis command adds the current user to the docker group. This is necessary\
      \ to run Docker commands without needing sudo. We confirmed the need for this\
      \ step by checking the Docker documentation and various Linux user guides.\n\
      \nAdd user to Docker group\n\n```\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n```\n\nAfter\
      \ running this command, I encountered a user account lockout issue after failing\
      \ my password three times with sudo. I found myself locked out, which was quite\
      \ alarming. However, after waiting for six minutes, I was able to log back in,\
      \ rerun the `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` command, log out and back in again,\
      \ and then finally check I was in the Docker group:\n\nCheck we are in the docker\
      \ group.\n\n```\n$ groups\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nsys network power docker lp\
      \ wheel bevan\n```\n\nExcellent we can see docker in the list of groups.\n\n\
      I ran the Hello World Docker image again:\n\n```\ndocker run hello-world\n```\n\
      \nThe output confirmed that Docker was installed correctly and running on my\
      \ system:\n\n```\nUnable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally\nlatest:\
      \ Pulling from library/hello-world\n0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:6a65f928fb91fcfbc963f7aa6d57c8eeb426ad9a20c7ee045538ef34847f44f1\n\
      Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest\nHello from Docker!\n\
      This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n\
      ```\n\nNext, I downloaded Lando manually from the GitHub releases page using\
      \ the following command:\n\n```\ncurl -OL https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/download/v3.1.8-0/lando-x64-v3.1.8-0.pacman\n\
      ```\n\nI then created a `lando.yml` file for my project. This file is used to\
      \ configure the Lando environment for the project. Here's a simple example of\
      \ what the `lando.yml` file might look like:\n\n```yaml\nname: basiq \nrecipe:\
      \ lamp\nconfig:\n  php: '8.1'\n  webroot: ./web\n  database: mariadb\n```\n\n\
      With the `lando.yml` file in place, I proceeded to start up my project:\n\n\
      ```\nlando start\n```\n\nI encountered a missing `libcrypt` library issue with\
      \ Lando, which prevented me from starting my local development environment.\
      \ The error message was:\n\n```\nerror while loading shared libraries: libcrypt.so.1:\
      \ cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n```\n\nWith some\
      \ assistance, I was able to resolve this issue by installing the missing library:\n\
      \n```\nsudo pacman -S libxcrypt\n```\n\nI started Lando again:\n\n```\nlando\
      \ start\n```\n\nI encountered a warning about an unsupported Docker version\
      \ and a \"Not Found\" error when trying to access my site.\nI spent some time\
      \ investigating downgrading the docker version, the only way on manjaro appears\
      \ to be as a tar.gz.\n\nI have a separate blog post all about it.\n\nHere is\
      \ the output that contains the warning:\n\n```\nLet's get this party started!\
      \ Starting app basiq...\nlandoproxyhyperion5000gandalfedition_proxy_1 is up-to-date\n\

      \ ENGINE\n   You have version 24.0.2 but Lando wants something in the 18.09.3\
      \ - 20.10.99 range.\n   If you have purposefully installed an unsupported version\
      \ and know what you are doing\n   you can probably ignore this warning. If not\
      \ we recommend you use a supported version\n   as this ensures we can provide\
      \ the best support and stability.\n   https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n\

      \ up Docker and Lando on my Manjaro Linux system, I moved on to the next step\
      \ of my journey: writing a simple \"Hello World\" PHP script and resolving some\
      \ issues with Lando.\n```\n\n## Writing a \"Hello World\" PHP Script\n\nThe\
      \ first task was to create a PHP script that echoes \"Hello World\" into `web/index.php`.\
      \ This is a simple task, but it's an important step in setting up any new PHP\
      \ project. Here's how I did it:\n\n```\nmkdir web\ncat <<EOF > web/index.php\n\
      <?php\necho 'Hello, World!';\nEOF\n```\n\nAfter running these commands, I had\
      \ a file named `index.php` in my `web` directory with the following content:\n\
      \n```php\n<?php\necho 'Hello, World!';\n```\n\nI verified this by running `cat\
      \ web/index.php` in my terminal. The output was the content of the PHP script.\n\
      \n## Resolving Lando Issues\n\nYou may recall that when I first started Lando\
      \ with `lando start`, I encountered a warning about an unsupported Docker version\
      \ and a \"Not Found\" error when trying to access my site. I'm currently working\
      \ on resolving these issues.\n\n## Review\n\nI now have a better understanding\
      \ of the Basiq platform and how to use its dashboard and API. I've successfully\
      \ installed Docker and Lando on my Manjaro Linux system, which are both necessary\
      \ steps for the upcoming web server setup. I successfully wrote a \"Hello World\"\
      \ PHP script and started to address some issues with Lando.\n\n## Uninstalling\
      \ Docker and Lando\n\nAfter successfully setting up Docker and Lando on my Manjaro\
      \ Linux system, I encountered a warning\n\n about an unsupported Docker version.\
      \ The Docker version installed was 24.0.2, while Lando supports Docker versions\
      \ in the range of 18.09.3 - 20.10.99. To resolve this, I decided to downgrade\
      \ Docker to a version compatible with Lando. The first step was to uninstall\
      \ the current Docker and Lando installations. Here's how I did it:\n\n```\n\
      sudo pacman -R lando\nsudo pacman -R docker\n```\n\nThe output of these commands\
      \ indicated that both Lando and Docker were successfully uninstalled.\n\n##\
      \ Docker Version Compatibility Issue\n\nWhile setting up Lando, we encountered\
      \ a Docker version compatibility issue. The version of Docker installed on the\
      \ system was newer than the one supported by Lando. Lando v3.1.8-0 supports\
      \ Docker version 20.10.7, but the system had Docker version 24.0.2 installed.\n\
      \n## Attempted Solutions\n\nWe attempted to downgrade Docker to a compatible\
      \ version using the package manager, but this proved to be a challenge. Here\
      \ are the steps we took:\n\n- Checked Docker version: We ran `docker version`\
      \ to confirm the installed Docker version. The output was `Docker version 24.0.2,\
      \ build cb74dfcd85`.\n- Attempted to downgrade Docker: We tried to downgrade\
      \ Docker to version 20.10.7 using the command `sudo pacman -S docker=20.10.7`.\
      \ However, this command was invalid as Pacman does not support version constraints\
      \ in this format.\n- Searched for a solution: We searched for a way to install\
      \ Docker 20.10.7 on Manjaro or Arch. The recommended solution was to use the\
      \ `downgrade` utility, which allows you to downgrade a package to a previous\
      \ version.\n- Attempted to use the `downgrade` utility: We ran `sudo downgrade\
      \ docker` to try and downgrade Docker. However, this did not provide a list\
      \ of versions to choose from, as we expected. Instead, it reinstalled the current\
      \ version of Docker.\n- Set environment variable for downgrading: We set the\
      \ `DOWNGRADE_FROM_ALA` environment variable to 1 to allow downgrading from the\
      \ Arch Linux Archive (ALA). However, running `sudo downgrade docker` again still\
      \ did not provide a list of versions to choose from.\n\n## Current Status\n\n\
      At this point, we found that Lando works with the newer Docker version, despite\
      \ the compatibility warning. AS Lando works as expected, we can continue using\
      \ the current setup. We also considered forking and patching Lando to support\
      \ the new Docker version. This would involve making changes to the Lando codebase,\
      \ testing the changes, and submitting a pull request to the Lando repository.\
      \ However, this would be a significant undertaking and would require a good\
      \ understanding of the Lando codebase. We might need to revisit installing Docker\
      \ from a .tar.gz file if we find issues down the track.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n\
      Close off phase 2 and start on Phase 3 - Writing real code / Accessing the API.\
