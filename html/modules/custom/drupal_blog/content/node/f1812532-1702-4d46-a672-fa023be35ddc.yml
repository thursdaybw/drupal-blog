      The journey of integrating the Basiq API into a simple web application has been
      an exciting one, filled with learning, challenges, and a few unexpected turns.
      As a PHP developer familiar with APIs, I embarked on this journey with the aim
      of retrieving account balance information for a specific savings account at
      a specific bank. The project was divided into a number of phases, which were
      adapted overtime as course adjustments were made. The intial phases were: understanding
      and planning for Basiq API integration, and setting up the local development
      environment, they have since broken out into 5 unique phases.


      ## Researching for a Relevant API Service


      The first step in this journey was to find a suitable API service that could
      provide the necessary account balance information. After some research, I settled
      on the Basiq API. Basiq is a platform that provides a secure and simple way
      to connect with financial data. Their API seemed to offer exactly what I needed
      for my web application. Unfortunately I did document this proces that well,
      it involved utilising chatgpt4 web and the voxplugin to browser the web and
      search and summarise the results. I approached it like a project, this project
      grew out of it and here we are now. The process involved reading summaries of
      a number of different resources related to the keywords "API" and "banking"
      there is

      lots of government policies, goverment apis, banks pushing their products with
      those terms, and it is all aimed and banks and providers not the end user like
      myself who just

      wants to access his own data via an API so he can manage his own data and automate
      things precisely. Evenutally I found Basiq and established that it just might
      be the tool I am after. Until I get my data back. It may be that the "Demo Application"
      will return dummy test data. And which point we expand to more phases of working
      through that challenge.

      Hopeing that there is a path forward.


      ## Learning About Basiq API


      The next step was to understand how to use the Basiq API and Dashboard. This
      was a bit of a challenge at first, as the Basiq Dashboard and API were new to
      me. However, with some time and effort, I was able to get a good grasp of how
      to use them. I learned how to make API requests, handle responses, and navigate
      the Basiq Dashboard. This knowledge was crucial for the next phase of the project.'
