SubStation Alpha (SSA) is a subtitling / script format that supports text formatting, animation, graphics and karaoke.[1] It is also the name of the program that is able to read SSA files. Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) is a newer version of SSA (technically version 4+).

File specification

SSA and ASS files are plain DOS text files. ASS added Unicode support.
ASS (SSA V4+)

ASS is an improvement upon the SSA V4 specification. ASS files have INI-style sections: each section is preceded by a line containing the sections name, in square brackets. Aside from this, each line is generally composed of: a line descriptor, which tells about what the line is about; a colon; and the line data itself. Any whitespace between these parts are allowed. Blank lines are also allowed. Hard comment lines are preceded by either a semicolon or !: (with "!" as the line descriptor).

Unrecognized and incorrect line formats are ignored.

Fields on the line data are separated by a comma and, with the exception of the Text field, which should be the last field, must not contain any commas.
Script Info section

The Script Info section contains general information about the file. The following is a sample Script Info section:

Descriptor name 	Description
A comment line.

Details regarding updates made to the script can be placed here.
Where in the video will the script begin playback
How collisions are managed. Possible values are: Normal - subtitles are stacked onto each other, and Reverse - subtitles are shifted to make way for new ones.

Styles section

The Styles section defines different preset styles that can be used to adjust the appearance of individual lines in the script. The actual name of the section depends on the file version, for ASS this is [V4+ Styles]. In the Events section, unrecognized styles are styled with the "Default" style. Unrecognized fonts are assigned to Arial - this may occur when the font is not installed in a target user's system. The following is a sample Styles section:

Events section

This section contains the different objects to be displayed on screen, each having its corresponding properties, including timing.

The following are the fields available to ASS:
Field 	Description
Layer 	An integer indicating the layer the subtitle is in. Subtitles having different layer numbers will be ignored during collision detection. Lower layer numbers are drawn first.
Start 	The start time of the subtitle. See the Data types section.
End 	The end time of the subtitle.
Style 	The style to be used by the script. Styles are defined in the Styles section.
Name 	The person who spoke the dialog.
MarginL
MarginR
MarginV 	4-digit margin override.
Effect 	An effect or special directive associated with the line. Possible values are:
Scroll up;<y1|0>;<y2|0>;<delay(1-100)>[;fadeawayheight],
Banner;<delay(1-100)>[;lefttoright(0|1)][;<fadeawaywidth],
Scroll down;<y1|0>;<y2|0>;<delay(1-100)>[;fadeawayheight]
Text 	The subtitle text. This is a special field in the sense that it must always be the last field, and can contain commas.

The following are the Event section descriptors:
Descriptor 	Description
Dialogue 	A normal subtitle line.
Comment 	A commented subtitle line. These will not be displayed on screen.
Picture 	Displays a picture with the path specified in the Text field.

Style overrides

The ASS format has an extensive set of overrides that can be used to modify parts of or whole specific subtitles. All override codes except for \N, \n and \h must be enclosed in curly brackets ({}). Consecutive override codes may be placed inside a single pair of brackets. Override codes typically affect only the text succeeding it, but some codes modify the whole line. All override codes are preceded by a backslash (\) and may contain a parameter, if it must be provided. If an override code requires 2 or more parameters, these are placed inside parentheses and are comma-delimited.

The following is a list of ASS override codes.
Override code 	Parameters 	Description
n 		Soft line break - the line may break here.
N 		Hard / forced line break
h 		Non-breaking space

r 	[style] 	Resets all previous override styles, applying the default style. To apply a different style, put it as a parameter.
t 	([<start>, <end>,][<accel>,]<styles>) 	Applies a transition animation to the line. The start and end times are in milliseconds, and the styles can be any combination of the available animatable styles.
pos 	(x,y) 	Sets the position of the subtitle anchor, where 0,0 is the top-left corner. Note that the subtitle anchor also depends on the line's alignment.
move 	(x1,y1,x2,y2[,t1, t2]) 	Animates the subtitle position at the specified time or at the entirety of the subtitle time from point 1 to point 2. Time is in milliseconds, relative to the beginning of the subtitle. The subtitle anchor depends on the line's alignment.

File attachment

Files can be attached to scripts and are stored as plain text. The method used is a form of UUEncoding.
Data types

Color
    Color values are expressed in hexadecimal BGR format as &HBBGGRR& or ABGR (with alpha channel) as &HAABBGGRR&. Transparency (alpha) can be expressed as &HAA&. Note that in the alpha channel, 00 is opaque and FF is transparent.
Boolean values (Styles section)
    -1 is true, 0 is false.
Alignment
    Alignment values are based on the numeric keypad. 1 - bottom left, 2 - bottom center, 3 - bottom right, 4 - center left, 5 - center center, 6 - center right, 7 - top left, 8 - top center, 9 - top right. In addition to determining the position of the subtitle, this also determines the alignment of the text itself.
Time
    Time is expressed as h:mm:ss:xx (xx being hundredths of seconds). The hour can only be a single digit.
